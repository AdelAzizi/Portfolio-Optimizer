# Roadmap Verification Checklist

To ensure the revised roadmap is complete, accurate, and ready for implementation, please review the following points:

## 1. Overall Alignment and Philosophy

*   **"Get to Profit Fast, Then Improve" Philosophy:** Does the roadmap clearly reflect this guiding principle, prioritizing early value delivery and iterative improvement?
*   **3-12 Month Investment Horizon:** Is the focus on this specific investment horizon maintained throughout the phases, particularly in factor selection, optimization, and backtesting?
*   **Iranian Stock Market Context:** Are the unique characteristics of the Iranian stock market (e.g., liquidity, risk-free rate, data challenges) adequately considered and addressed in the strategy and implementation steps?

## 2. Clarity and Detail of Phases

*   **Clear Objectives:** Is the objective for each phase clearly stated and understandable?
*   **Actionable Key Tasks:** Are the key tasks within each phase specific, actionable, and suitable for an AI assistant to execute?
*   **Defined Deliverables:** Are the expected deliverables for each phase clearly outlined?
*   **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Does the roadmap provide a logical, step-by-step progression from one phase to the next?

## 3. Addressing Critique Concerns

*   **Codal Data Acquisition:** Does the roadmap explicitly postpone complex Codal data scraping to later phases, focusing on price-derived factors initially?
*   **Overfitting Mitigation:** Does the roadmap include strategies to mitigate overfitting, such as starting with simple, proven factors, emphasizing economic rationale, and using robust backtesting methodologies?
*   **Farsi NLP:** Is Farsi NLP reclassified as a long-term, optional enhancement, not part of the immediate core development?

## 4. Project Structure and Documentation Emphasis

*   **Clean and Organized Structure:** Does the roadmap emphasize and guide towards a clean, modular, and well-organized project structure (e.g., `factors/`, `data/` directories)?
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Does the roadmap explicitly require:
    *   Detailed inline code comments for all functions, classes, and complex logic?
    *   Module-specific READMEs (e.g., `factors/README.md`, `data/README.md`)?
    *   An overarching `README.md` for the entire project, including:
        *   Project overview and key features?
        *   A clear project structure diagram (textual or ASCII)?
        *   An architectural overview explaining component interactions and data flow?
        *   Installation and usage instructions?
        *   Summary of factors and backtesting methodology?
*   **Interpretability and Defensibility:** Is the emphasis on making the code and strategy transparent, understandable, and defensible consistently maintained?

## 5. Practicality and Realism

*   **Avoid Unnecessary Complexity:** Does the roadmap avoid introducing overly complex solutions where simpler, effective alternatives exist, especially in the initial phases?
*   **Focus on Practicality:** Are the proposed solutions and tasks realistic and achievable within the context of the Iranian stock market and available resources?
*   **Test-Driven Approach:** Does the roadmap consistently include steps for testing and verification after each significant change or addition?

By reviewing these points, you can confirm that the roadmap is comprehensive, addresses all your requirements, and sets a solid foundation for your AI assistant to proceed with the development of the quantitative investment system.
